The rapid advancement of generative AI models has outpaced the development of appropriate evaluation metrics. Current approaches often rely on proxy measures that fail to capture important dimensions of model performance.[^1]

## Current Limitations

Most evaluation frameworks focus on:

- Perplexity‑based measures  
- Human evaluation with limited samples  
- Automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE  

These approaches suffer from several well‑documented issues:[^2]

> **Key Problems:**  
> 1. Poor correlation with human judgment  
> 2. Insensitivity to subtle quality differences  
> 3. Failure to detect harmful outputs  

## Proposed Framework

We propose a multi‑dimensional evaluation framework based on the following equation:

$$
Q = \alpha \cdot \mathrm{Fidelity} \;+\; \beta \cdot \mathrm{Diversity} \;+\; \gamma \cdot \mathrm{Novelty}
$$

Where:

- **Fidelity** measures output quality and coherence  
- **Diversity** captures the range of possible outputs  
- **Novelty** assesses creative generation beyond training data  

The weights \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) can be adjusted based on application requirements. Our experiments show this framework provides more nuanced evaluation than single‑score metrics.[^3]

## Implementation

The evaluation pipeline consists of three main components:

```python
def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    # Calculate fidelity score
    fidelity = calculate_fidelity(model, test_data)
    
    # Calculate diversity score
    diversity = calculate_diversity(model, test_data)
    
    # Calculate novelty score
    novelty = calculate_novelty(model, test_data)
    
    # Combine with weights
    total_score = 0.5*fidelity + 0.3*diversity + 0.2*novelty
    
    return {
        'fidelity': fidelity,
        'diversity': diversity,
        'novelty': novelty,
        'total_score': total_score
    }
```
Initial results across 5 benchmark datasets show improved correlation with human evaluation (r=0.87 vs 0.62 for traditional metrics).
