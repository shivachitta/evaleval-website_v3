description: Building upon the momentum of NeurIPS 2024, our primary focus is to strategically plan our engagement with a major annual academic venue, likely NeurIPS, to showcase high-quality research and technical contributions. In parallel, we aim to cultivate a QueerInAI-esque presence at other relevant venues by organizing social events and short talks to broaden our reach and foster community engagement. Complementing these outreach efforts, we will also pursue active research engagements and develop centralised resources to support our community.
